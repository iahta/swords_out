### 1. Room Class:
Each room will have a name, a description, and options for which rooms can be accessed next (e.g., doors leading to other rooms).

### 2. Estate Class:
The estate will hold a collection of rooms and handle the randomization of room connections.

### 3. Player Class:
The player will need to store their current position and handle the player’s movement through the rooms.

Here’s a basic structure to get started:

### Code:

```python



### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **Room Class**:
   - Each room has a `name`, `description`, and a list of `connected_rooms`. 
   - The `add_connection` method adds a connection to another room.
   - The `describe` method provides information about the room.

2. **Estate Class**:
   - Contains the rooms and the logic to randomize connections between them.
   - The `move` method allows the player to move between rooms.

3. **Player Class**:
   - Handles the player’s name and the action of choosing which room to go to.

4. **Randomization of Room Connections**:
   - In the `Estate.randomize_rooms()` method, room connections are randomized. For each room, it selects a random number of rooms and connects them.

5. **Game Loop**:
   - The game continues asking for input (to move to a connected room) until the player decides to stop.

### Game Flow:
- When the game starts, the player begins in the “Main Hall.”
- The estate has multiple rooms, and each room has random connections to others.
- The player can navigate the rooms, and the game will tell them where they can go next.
  
### Improvements:
- Add more detailed descriptions to the rooms.
- Add items, enemies, or puzzles in the rooms.
- Implement a quit condition or an "end game" scenario.

Does this approach look good, or would you like to tweak anything?
